            <p>As a photographer with a unique perspective, Itu draws inspiration from experiences in two vibrant cities, Johannesburg and Cape Town. With a passion for capturing the beauty in a variety of people, places, and things, he uses his lens to tell stories that blend the rhythms of urban life with the beauty of the human experience.
                Itu's photography journey has taken him from the bustling streets of Joburg to the charming landscapes of Cape Town, and everywhere in between. He is constantly seeking new ways to frame the world around him and is excited to share his vision with you.</p>
